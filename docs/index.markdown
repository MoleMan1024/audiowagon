# AudioWagon documentation

This app will **play audio files** from an attached **USB flash drive** in cars equipped with **Androidâ„¢ Automotive OS**
(for example Polestar 2â„¢, Volvo XC40 Rechargeâ„¢, &hellip;)[^1].

## âš  2022-07-04 âš  Important notice for US / UK users

It looks like the most recent car software update 2.2 is different in the United States / United Kingdom. It does not
include CarPlay and also the USB port will not yet work with that version. 

Here is what Polestar said on their Facebook page:

> Weâ€™ve begun to redeploy the latest OTA software update incrementally in batches and two versions are available for
> download:
> 1. For customers in all markets except the UK and US, P2.2 with the full set of enhancements, including Apple CarPlay
>    will be available for download.
> 2. For customers in the UK and US, P2.2 which does not have Apple CarPlay, will be available for download.  
> 
> Weâ€™re working hard on releasing P2.2 with the full set of enhancements as a top priority for all customers in the US and
> UK and sincerely apologise for the inconvenience. 

That means the AudioWagon app will not work in the US / UK right now, you will need another update from Polestar /
Volvo.

## Release notes

Please see Github for a [list of changes for each version of the app](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Limitations

- The app will *not* work with Polestar/Volvo OTA car software version 2.0 nor 2.1. You will need the car software
  version 2.2 or higher that includes the CarPlay Update (or 1.9 or lower). 

  âš  NOTE âš : In UK / USA a different variant of 2.2 has been rolled out by Polestar/Volvo without CarPlay (and it looks
  like without USB data support which AudioWagon requires).
- The app can *not* play back **.wma** files
- *Some* people have reported issues when using the app with a **USB to micro SD card adapter** where no files could be
  played back and lots of error messages were shown. In such cases the adapter is probably not compatible with the
  library I use to read the filesystem, please try with a USB flash drive instead, I have not heard about problems with
  those. 

  *This problem applies only to certain adapters*, I also have reports where similar adapters were working
  normally. The following hardware setups might give you issues and should be avoided:
  - Transcend USB-A 3.0 adapter, white, with SD and ÂµSD slot, using a ÂµSD card
  - unknown brand USB-A to ÂµSD adapter, black, with label "MicroSD, USB2.0 Y", using a ÂµSD card
  - unknown brand USB-A to ÂµSD adapter, black, with label "MjX R/C Technic", using a ÂµSD card
  - unknown brand USB-C adapter, gray, with SD and ÂµSD slot and LED, using another adapter SD to ÂµSD, using a ÂµSD card
    (this one could be fixed by removing the second unnecessary adapter)

## How to use

- Install the app via the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.moleman1024.audiowagon)

- Format a USB flash drive using **FAT32** filesystem (in Windows you can use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) for example).

![format](/img/format.jpg)

- Insert the USB flash drive into the car's USB port that is connected to the Android infotainment system (usually
  **marked with a white outline**). Depending on your car model, you might need an adapter for USB-C.

![USB port](/img/port.jpg)
![USB port plugged](/img/insert_usb.jpg)

- Wait a few seconds, then tap OK to **allow access** to the USB drive contents in the popup window

![Permission popup](/img/allow_access.jpg)

- If you have installed the app for the first time, you have to do the following 3 extra steps: you get a warning that 
  you need to accept the legal disclaimer in the settings. Open the AudioWagon settings using the gear icon.

![Legal disclaimer not agreed](/img/legal_disclaimer_not_agreed.jpg)

- In the settings screen tap on "Show legal disclaimer"

![Settings](/img/settings.jpg)

- Read through the legal disclaimer and tap "Agree". Then return to the main screen using the arrow in top
  left corner.

- Enjoy ðŸ¤©


## Frequently asked questions

See [the FAQ section]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link faq.markdown %}).

## How do I report an issue?

If you encounter any issues, please let me know so I can fix them. If possible provide all of the following info to me
at my email (or you can use [GitHub](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues)):

- What happened? Describe ALL steps that you did EXACTLY. Please mention even minor details (e.g. did you leave/enter
  the car before you saw the issue occur?). Also be precise: saying that something "does not work"/"is broken" is not
  helpful, rather describe what the behaviour of the app actually is.
- What did you expect to happen?
- At what date/time did the issue happen? (so I can align with the timestamps in the log files)
- Which *version of AudioWagon* were you using? (version number can be found in the settings screen)
- Which version is your car's software? (e.g. P2124 on a Polestar 2)
- *Log files* are being created continously on your USB drive (if this is enabled in the settings). Please attach these
  log files from around the date/time when the issue happened. If unsure about the date, just provide everything. If you
  can reproduce the issue easily, turn on logging in the settings, do whatever you need to trigger the issue, then turn
  logging off again, then the latest log file should contain the issue. The log files have filenames like
  `aw_logs_0/audiowagon_<date_and_time>.log`. These files are very important, without this I only have your description
  of the issue to work with.


## How to contribute?

### Native speakers

I am still looking for **volunteer native speakers to translate** the GUI texts in the app to all languages
(already translated: German, English, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, French, Russian, Polish). You can get the
[English strings to translate here](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/blob/master/automotive/src/main/res/values/strings.xml).
