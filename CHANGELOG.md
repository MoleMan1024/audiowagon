# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Listed here are only software version that have been made public. A jump in the version number (e.g. from 0.2.5 to
0.3.4) without any inbetween version means that multiple internal releases were made that were not made available to the
public.

The date given for a release is when the app is pushed into Google Play Store. However it will be visible only after
Google's review process which can take a couple of days.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project loosely follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [2.5.6] - 2023-10-07

### Fixed

- ignore permission change events for USB device objects which are no longer connected
- updates to notification channels were posted from main thread which could make the app unresponsive (ANR) in rare
  cases. Now this is done from threads

### Changed

- try to recover from failed USB initializations whenever possible. But most of the times a recovery is impossible
  [#91](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/91)
- wait 4 seconds before showing the USB permission popup. This should be sufficient time for the USB subsystem to
  power-cycle the USB device in case of issues that would otherwise cancel the permission popup
- react to USB timeout errors more quickly
- when USB device was attached, but permission to access it was denied, this was not easily visible. This situation is
  now shown in the main browse view also (lock icon)
- more logging
- internal refactoring


## [2.5.2] - 2023-08-16

### Fixed

- I discovered a forum post about some **issues in Renault cars** with Android 10 when using AudioWagon: After scrolling 
  items with album art for some time, the album art squares would turn into gray squares and shortly later the GUI would 
  partially break and not show anything at all anymore. I encountered a similar issue on my development build on a 
  mobile phone, but only in the media browse view. I believe this to be the same issue. Volvo/Polestar users are 
  *not* affected it seems, because they use Android 11 which does not have this bug. The issue seems to be only in cars
  with Android 10 when using album art. The way that album art is transferred to the GUI has been changed now, which
  should fix this [#127](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/127).
- a small problem was introduced in last update: when starting up AudioWagon with no USB drive plugged in, the screen
  would say "Please wait" indefinitely. This message was not accurate and has been fixed.


## [2.5.1] - 2023-08-11

### Fixed

- minor translation inconsistency in German

### Changed

- some icons were updated

### Added

- the 4 view tabs at the top of the browse view ("Tracks", "Albums", "Artists", "Files") are now configurable in the 
  AudioWagon settings. You can now show only those categories that you use and order them however you want (feature 
  request [#124](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/124)).
- translation for Hungarian
- some icons were added


## [2.4.7] - 2023-07-09

### Fixed

- artist groups were not being created correctly, because they did not take into account the rules for album artists
  in ticket [#22](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/22). This had the effect that the last artist group
  was missing some artists. This has been fixed. To get this change working, you will need to re-index your database
  [#122](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/122)
- As described in the [FAQ](https://moleman1024.github.io/audiowagon/faq.html#album-artists), only album artists shall be
  shown in the artists view. When an artist was added to the database, and it was not marked as an album artist in the
  first track found for that artist, it would not be shown, even if marked as album artist in other tracks. This has
  been improved: the behaviour is no longer determined only by the first track found.


## [2.4.6] - 2023-06-23

### Fixed

- fixed some concurrency issues related to new multi-threaded library creation
- catch OutOfMemoryException when loading large embedded album art
- cache only downsized album art instead of full-sized album art to save memory
- try to avoid an ANR when writing remaining logging during shutdown
- minor library update


## [2.4.5] - 2023-06-18

### Fixed

- Google has fixed an [issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/212779546) meanwhile that was preventing a
  feature in voice search to work properly. It was discovered there is an issue when using this feature in AudioWagon
  to search for artist or album by voice. This has been fixed.
  [#119](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/119)
- When shuffle mode was on and the user selected a track inside an album or a file inside a directory, the playback
  queue would start in random order, but not with the selected track/file. This was confusing and has been fixed, a
  shuffled playback queue will now always start with the item the user selected.
  [#120](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/120)
- The fix for issue [#83](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/83) was only applied for all tracks on a
  single album but not for playlists nor when playing all tracks of an artist. This has been fixed.

### Changed

- search results within one media type will now be sorted alphabetically
- major internal refactoring was done to be able to experiment with different libraries more easily (*libusb* does not
  bring any improvement over accessing USB via Android Java code)
- *libaums* library source code was integrated into version control and modified in many places to make it thread-safe
- performance was improved during indexing of metadata (fine grained locks and multiple coroutines to build
  the media library are now used)
- creating a shuffled playback queue of tracks is now a bit faster
  [#121](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/discussions/121)
- improvements to exception handling and some error messages


## [2.3.10] - 2023-05-21

### Fixed

- when converting audio files from one file type to another (e.g. from .m4a to .mp3) and using embedded album art the
  database could still point to the old filename. In such cases no album art was shown, a database deletion was needed
  to recover. This has been improved: modification of album art in existing audio files or changes of file extensions
  will now correctly update the album art location in the database
  [#118](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/118)

### Changed

- ignore built-in USB devices found in GMC Sierra trucks
- updated some library dependencies to latest version


## [2.3.8] - 2023-03-26

### Changed

- indexing speed was a bit slow when having many directories on the USB drive without any changes compared to last time
  the drive was indexed. The indexing speed has been improved by removing some not-necessary database operations
  [#112](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/112)
- updated some Google library dependencies to latest version

### Added

- translation for Japanese


## [2.3.7] - 2023-02-28

### Fixed

- when writing log files to the USB drive in rare cases the filesystem got corrupted. This has been fixed
  [#105](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/105)
- the pseudo artist "Various artists" used for compilation albums could show up multiple times in multiple cases when
  users would tag such files as "Various Artists" (note the capital letter 'A' in 'Artists' versus lowercase 'artists').
  Now any casing of "Various artists" in metadata will be used for the pseudo compilation artist. Also this pseudo
  artist will now be localized in the GUI (e.g. "Verschiedene KÃ¼nstler" in German). To make full use of this fix you
  will need to re-index your database [#110](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/110)

### Changed

- the musical note icon for tracks did not look very nice in the Volvo GUI, it was replaced with a microphone icon
- the number of items found during indexing on the GUI did not include files/directories, only audiofiles with metadata
  were shown. Now files/directories will be counted as well, resulting in a higher total number. During indexing you
  will first see the items increasing quickly based on the directories, and later a bit more slowly when the actual
  metadata in the audio files is read


## [2.3.6] - 2023-01-27

### Fixed

- ensure log lines are written in correct order to log file
- try to avoid `MissingNotifChannelException` during startup

### Changed

- extraction of metadata is now faster [#103](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/103)
- hidden resource fork files created by Apple OS X are now ignored when indexing
  [#107](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/107)
- avoid spamming logfile with stacktraces when there are lots of mismatches between media library and persisted playback
  queue
- ignore another built-in USB device found in some car using AAOS
- the indexing notification visible to the user is now updated earlier to indicate more clearly that the media library
  indexing is actually in progress (from 0 to 100 it is now updated every 20 files. Above 100 files it is unchanged
  and is updated every 100 files)
- increased log file write frequency

### Added

- ReplayGain tags in .opus files are now taken into account
  [#99](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/99)


## [2.3.1] - 2022-11-26

### Fixed

- a regression was fixed where album art was no longer displayed
  [#92](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/92)
- the eject function was not properly releasing all resources, this has been fixed

### Changed

- Apple Lossless Audio ("alac") is not supported by the Android platform. Previously, when trying to play back such files
  AudioWagon would show an "unknown error". Now the error message will say "Not supported" instead.
  [#94](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/94)
- When the *AudioBrowserService* was started while the screen was still off the app would try to access the USB device,
  even though this situation seems to happen most often before going into suspend-to-RAM. The app will now no longer try
  to query and/or index USB devices while the screen is off.
- some micro-SD card readers show a "Unit attention ASCQ 40" error message when being plugged in. However it turns out
  this error can usually be ignored, those devices should now work with AudioWagon
- ignoring some more built-in USB devices found in Renault cars that use AAOS
- cancel some more coroutines that were possibly still running when going into shutdown/suspend


## [2.2.8] - 2022-11-05

### Changed

- trying to avoid issue with `MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS` when waking up from sleep
- trying to reduce memory usage of album art
- ignoring some more built-in USB devices found in General Motors and Renault cars that use AAOS


## [2.2.5] - 2022-09-26

### Changed

- increased the number in `MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS` in *libaums* back to 20 in case USB is busy and cannot do bulk
  transfers right away (seen a bit more often recently in *Crashlytics*).


## [2.2.4] - 2022-09-04

### Fixed

- selecting a track in an album inside artist view would erroneously play all songs from that artist instead of just the
  tracks on that album. This has been fixed.
  [#89](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/89)


## [2.2.3] - 2022-08-28

### Fixed

- fixed a situation where AudioWagon became unresponsive when loading external cover art image files
  [#88](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/88)


## [2.2.2] - 2022-08-23

### Fixed

- fixed an issue in *Crashlytics* logging
- added another USB device to the list of built-in devices to be ignored
- avoid a crash when closing a USB file does not finish within 10 seconds


## [2.2.1] - 2022-08-20

### Fixed

- album art was not shown for tracks that did not have an album name in metadata, this has been fixed
  [#79](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/79)
- confined all access to *libaums* to a single thread because the library is not thread-safe. Hopefully this will fix a
  rare filesystem corruption [#80](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/80)
- sometimes albums/artists with no associated tracks were kept in database, those are now properly cleaned up
  [#82](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/82)
- when starting a new playback queue with shuffle mode turned on, the first track was never shuffled. This issue was
  related to the intended behaviour that the currently playing track shall not be modified when toggling shuffle mode.
  The issue been fixed [#83](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/83)
- try to avoid hangs (ANRs) in different places by refactoring blocking coroutines
- try to avoid a `IllegalStateException` that could occur in Settings screen sometimes
- fixed an issue during quick service startup/shutdown where coroutines were not cancelled properly during
  restoring of persistent state
- fixed multiple issues when writing log files to USB drive
- fixed some problems in `LogActivity`
- handled a rare `IndexOutOfBoundsException` when setting up filesystem partitions
- made sure that stack traces arrive in *Crashlytics* logs fully

### Changed

- when persisting the playback queue, only upcoming tracks were stored. This has been changed to persist the complete
  playback queue instead [#78](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/78)
- when a user cancelled the permission popup, or if the permission request was denied automatically, you had to re-plug
  the USB drive to make the permission pop-up appear again. Now the permission popup will be triggered again when
  entering *AudioWagon* settings (in case the permission was not yet given)
  [#76](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/76)
- the eject icon could be tapped accidentally while driving because it was nearby the skip backwards icon. To avoid
  accidental presses the eject icon has been moved into the extra icon drawer next to shuffle and repeat icons. A
  seek-backwards icon was added in its original place which is less annoying if tapped accidentally
  [#74](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/74)
- for *Crashlytics* exception catching we now log the maximum amount of log lines possible (64 kB) instead of just the
  last 100 lines (because it was confusing during analysis of logs)
- *libaums* and other library version updates
- update of icons
- internal refactoring (mainly in coroutines)

### Added

- translation for Italian


## [2.0.1] - 2022-07-03

### Fixed

- avoid a RuntimeException during service initialization in certain cases


## [2.0.0] - 2022-06-23

This release contains some major new features. When upgrading you will be required to re-index metadata from your USB
drives (if you were using that feature) because the database structure has changed significantly. If you find any
issues, please [contact me](https://moleman1024.github.io/audiowagon/index.html#how-do-i-report-an-issue).

### Fixed

- audio files in .m3u playlists with relative path markers could not be played back. This has been fixed.
  [#65](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/65)
- groups of items in large media libraries are now shown more quickly due to database redesign
  [#38](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/38)

### Added

- album art is now being shown for all tracks and albums when browsing
- a setting was added to show album art in a larger grid view. This setting is enabled by default. Changing this setting
  will only have an effect on next infotainment start or when restarting system app "Media Center"
  [#57](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/57)
- the file view now supports playing back a whole directory hierarchy [#50](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/50).
  Also you can now search for files and directories [#34](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/34). To use
  these features metadata indexing must be turned on in the settings screen (using any setting other than "off")
- articles (e.g. "The", "A") and some other symbols are now ignored when sorting media items. For example an entry like
  "The Beatles" will no longer appear near other artists starting with letter "T" but will now appear near "B".
  [#60](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/60)
- disc numbers in metadata are now being taken into account when sorting by track number.
  [#62](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/62)


## [1.5.6] - 2022-04-02

### Added

- some users that have gotten a new Polestar / Volvo car software version 2.0 with Android Automotive OS 11 in workshops
  have reported that USB drives are no longer detected. This is required for AudioWagon to work at all. I would like to
  investigate this issue before the update is rolled out via OTA to many users mid of April. To investigate, I added a
  possiblity to view the log file on screen via AudioWagon settings and tapping on the "version" field. It would be very
  helpful if someone that has this issue could provide me some photos of the contents of this log window before
  and after they plug in their USB drive, maybe there is an error message in there that will help me fix this
  [#68](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/68)


## [1.5.0] - 2022-02-26

### Fixed

- when AudioWagon was set to "Read metadata manually", and a file was deleted from USB drive, and the metadata was not
  updated by the user, and the track for that missing file was requested to be played, then the playback would just
  hang. This is improved now to show an error popup for the missing file and the playback queue will continue to the
  next track (if still available on USB drive)

### Changed

- prepare for AAOS 12 where toasts are no longer allowed for non-system apps. Replaced all toast messages with error
  states in PlaybackStateCompat which have the same visual effect

### Added

- Playlist files (.m3u, .pls and .xspf) that reference other files on the USB drive can now be played back from the
  file view. [#51](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/51)


## [1.4.0] - 2022-02-12

### Fixed

- robustness improvements

### Added

- added Polish translation

### Changed

- updated Dutch translation
- modified skip backwards threshold added in version 1.3.0 to 10 seconds (down from 20 seconds)
- logging improvements


## [1.3.0] - 2022-01-12

### Fixed

- robustness improvements

### Changed

- show an error message to the user when audio effects (equalizer, ReplayGain) can not be used

### Added

- added Russian translation
- the behaviour when skipping backwards has changed: when the currently playing track has played less than 20 seconds,
  the skip previous buttons will go to the previous track in the playback queue. However when the currently playing
  track has already played more than 20 seconds, the previous buttons will now restart the track. This is more in-line
  with the behaviour in other media software [#45](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/45)
- the app has been extended to support album art in directories. The highest priority is the album art embedded in the
  audio file. If no such album art is found, the app will now look also for .jpg or .png in the same directory as the
  audio file with usual filenames (e.g. "front.jpg", "folder.png", "cover.jpg", "index.jpg", "albumart.jpg", etc.)
  [#36](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/36)


## [1.2.5] - 2021-12-25

### Fixed

- robustness improvements

### Changed

- show an error message to the user when a file can not be played back
- send last 100 log file lines to Crashlytics when errors/crashes occur to be able to analyze the cause of the issue
- now that a web browser is available, added a link to the AudioWagon website from within the settings


## [1.2.2] - 2021-12-10

### Fixed

- finally fixed the RemoteServiceException I was seeing. This was related to the media hardware button behaviour
  depending on timing. You should now be able to still restart the most recent media session using the play/pause
  next/previous hardware buttons after leaving AudioWagon [#56](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/56)
- the app will now store a bit less data on disk when playing back a random selection of tracks
- fixed "play music" speech command when player was stopped
- improved service lifecycle handling


## [1.2.0] - 2021-12-04

### Changed

- extended the option "Read metadata" with a "manual" setting. This allows you to index metadata of audio files on the
  connected USB drive at your request only. The
  [FAQ was updated](https://moleman1024.github.io/audiowagon/faq.html#what-happens-during-indexing) with a section
  explaining the behaviour. [#21](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/21)

### Added

- added a setting to select the behaviour of the app when listening to audio and a route guidance voice prompt needs to
  be played. You can now select to either pause the audio (more suitable for audiobooks) or continue playing the audio
  at a lower volume (more suitable for music). [#24](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/24)
- I still see RemoteServiceExceptions in the Google Play Console but no user has reported any issue to me. That's why
  I added *Google Firebase Crashlytics* to the app now to see where exactly these crashes are coming from. This
  Crashlytics library will send more detailed error/crash information to me via internet. This setting is disabled by
  default for data privacy reasons, please see the
  [privacy policy](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md). You will also need to
  re-accept the legal disclaimer.


## [1.1.4] - 2021-11-29

### Fixed

- fixed an issue in 1.1.3 where number of characters for directory groups in browse view was not calculated
  [#54](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/54)


## [1.1.3] - 2021-11-27

### Fixed

- avoid to extract ReplayGain from a track when such a track does not exist
- AudioWagon will store the last playback position when you exit the app. However after reaching the end of a playback
  queue and exiting the app, AudioWagon would still restore a previous playback state from somewhere earlier in the
  playback queue which was confusing. Now, when the playback queue ends (without repeat mode), the stored playback
  position will be cleared instead.

### Changed

- create album art bitmaps based on the root hint size provided by MediaBrowser clients which should slightly improve
  memory consumption
- calculate the possible number of characters based on screen resolution to be able to use more available screen space
  for artist/album/track group names in the browse view
- try once more to avoid the elusive RemoteServiceExceptions
- improve robustness slightly when suspending to RAM
- internal refactoring
- added testcases


## [1.1.0] - 2021-11-16

### Fixed

- A situation could occur where indexing was started multiple times in parallel which would mess up the internal
  database. This is avoided now. [#46](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/46),
  [#49](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/49)
- Depending on timing of certain events sometimes two USB permission popups could appear right after each other e.g.
  after entering the car. Now only one popup should be displayed. Related to [#46](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/46)
- Try to avoid an exception which occurs after updating the app to a higher version
- Avoid that a selected track from the tracks browse view is duplicated in the resulting playback queue
- robustness improvements

### Changed

- The app will now interpret the *album artist* field in the metadata of your music files. To make use of this feature
  when updating from 1.0.1 or lower you will need to delete your database via the AudioWagon settings to force the app
  to re-create the database. [#22](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/22) and
  [#1](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/1).
  The behaviour has been documented in a
  [FAQ section](https://moleman1024.github.io/audiowagon/faq.html#why-do-my-compilation-albums-show-up-as-separate-albums).


## [1.0.1] - 2021-11-08 (beta phase ended)

### Fixed

- quotation marks in GUI texts were not showing up, this has been fixed

### Added

- voice commands such as "play &lt;artist name | album name | track name&gt;" should now work
  [#43](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/43)
- added a GUI toast popup to show the search query after a voice input by the user. This is done to make it clear to the
  user what is being searched for so that they can adjust their voice input in case the search fails


## [0.6.4] - 2021-11-05

### Fixed

- fix regression where log files were created without content [#42](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/42)
- fix regression where sorting order of items inside track/album/artist groups was wrong
  [#44](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/44)


## [0.6.2] - 2021-11-02

### Fixed

- fix an issue where app settings screen could not be opened when clearing all app-specific data or after re-installing
  the app [#41](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/41)
- improved latency of some database lookups
- improve robustness


## [0.6.1] - 2021-11-01

### Fixed

- fix filesystem corruption due to issues in *libaums* library. This will also remove the limitation
  of having max 128 files per directory. The issue was a combination of ignoring data when reading long FAT cluster
  chains as well as unintended writing to USB filesystem while reading from it in multiple threads
  [#37](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/37)


## [0.6.0] - 2021-10-26

### Fixed

- avoid a crash when a file can not be found for some reason
- fix issue where files could be played without agreeing to legal disclaimer

### Changed

- remove not needed wake lock permission

### Added

- Danish and French translation
- you can now delete internal databases of USB drives that were previously indexed via the settings screen to save space.
  The database of the currently in-use USB drive can not be deleted while it is in use, you have to eject the drive first.
  Previously it was only possible to delete the data of the whole app including all settings via the Android system
  settings [#2](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/2)
- ReplayGain on track level is now supported to normalize volume across many different tracks
  [#9](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/9)
- some more icons in settings screen


## [0.5.0] - 2021-10-18

### Fixed

- prevent that multiple audio file storage location objects are used, this could maybe help with filesystem corruption
  [#33](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/33)
- avoid some errors with empty content hierarchy IDs
- abort indexing when USB file reading methods throw unrecoverable I/O exceptions

### Changed

- prevent that USB indexing process is stopped when switching to another media app. This will allow a user to
  e.g. listen to the radio or use other media apps while an USB drive is being indexed. Previously the indexing process
  could be interrupted in that case [#19](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/19)
- enabling shuffle mode will now move the current item in the playback queue to the beginning of the playback queue
- latency decreased when selecting a single track for playback

### Added

- added directory/file browsing [#26](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/26)
- added a switch in the settings to turn off reading of audio file metadata. In case users want to use only the
  directory/file browsing, they can turn this off so the USB drive is not indexed anymore
- added an eject button to settings screen so users have the option to eject the USB drive to abort indexing
- added icons for main categories in browse view


## [0.4.0] - 2021-10-04

### Fixed

- for cars like Polestar 2 version P2127 or higher when entering the car the audio will resume playing if it was playing
  previously. This should now also work with AudioWagon [#15](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/15)
- the USB filesystem could get corrupted when the car was exited (and thus Android suspended) when indexing was ongoing.
  Some improvements were made that should avoid this issue [#27](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/27)
- with large media libraries the browse view could sometimes freeze for multiple seconds due to too large database
  queries. This is now avoided [#28](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/28)
- in case of many files missing metadata the number of entries in the "unknown artist/album" category could grow too big
  to be properly displayed. This is now avoided by using groups in the browse view
  [#29](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/29)
- sanitize year strings in metadata formatted like timestamps
- stability improvements (more exception handling)

### Changed

- some users did not understand that selecting a single track e.g. in an album would only play that track and nothing
  else, they expected the next/previous track buttons to work also. This design was changed, selecting a track inside an
  artist/album view will now play all items in the shown list starting from the selected item
  [#18](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/18)
- initial indexing speed is slightly improved


## [0.3.4] - 2021-09-18

### Added

- added translations for Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian

### Changed

- add uncaught exception handler that will flush to USB if possible to have more information before app exits
- do not store USB status in settings persistently
- try to improve recovery of app after issues with USB drive
  [#5](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/5)
- added more exception handling
- more logging, removed obfuscation from stack traces

### Fixed

- store USB status in settings as ID instead of as localized strings to avoid English strings in other languages being
  shown
- improved USB status update in settings on development phone with USBDummyActivity
- fix app failure with large music libraries: previously more than approx. 500 tracks could cause issues, now it should
  work fine with up to approx. 150000 tracks [#6](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/6)
- notify user if USB drive is full but logging to file on USB drive is enabled
  [#7](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/7)
- fix issues with files that contain a percent sign in the filename
  [#11](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/11)
- avoid issue where USB filesystem is corrupted when more than 128 files are put in root directory. Users are notified
  about this and asked to add subdirectories on their USB drive. A real fix will require a change in libaums.
  [#13](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/13)
- avoid issue where indexing slows down on files which are not supported. Previously the app tried to index .wma files
  as well which caused a 5 second delay on each of those files as .wma is not supported. Such files are now ignored
  [#14](https://github.com/MoleMan1024/audiowagon/issues/14)


## [0.2.5] - 2021-09-03

### Added
