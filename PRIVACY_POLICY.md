## Data collection

The AudioWagon app does *not send or receive any data via the internet* directly, it only uses data stored on the USB
drive or in the app-specific database created in the car's filesystem.

The app does *not* collect any location data, IP/MAC addresses or similar, thus this information is also *not*
contained in the log file.

## Log files

There is a *setting to collect log files* created by the app which will be written to the connected USB drive. This
setting is *off by default*. The logfile needs to be voluntarily provided by the user of the app to the developer, it
is *not transferred automatically*.

The log file contains some possibly identifiable information:

- filenames and metadata of audio files on the USB drive
- volume name, brand and manufacturer of the USB drive

## Sharing usage & diagnostics data via Google

The Android Automotive system however may collect some information regarding the usage of the app and will also send
crash reports to me via internet. This is a feature implemented by Google, not by the app. [Check here to learn more
about this feature and how to turn it off](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6078260?hl=en) (however as a
developer I should point out that it is quite helpful to me to get reports about crashes so I can improve the app).
