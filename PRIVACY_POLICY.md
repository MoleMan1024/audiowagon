## Data collection

The AudioWagon app does *not send or receive any data via the internet*. The app only uses data stored on the USB
drive or in the app-specific database created in the car's filesystem.

The app does *not* collect any location data, IP/MAC addresses or similar, thus this information is also *not*
contained in the log file.

## Log files

The app has a *setting to collect log files*. These log files will be written to the attached USB drive. This
setting is *off by default*. The user of the app may voluntarily provide this log file to the developer for debugging
purposes, it is *not transferred automatically*.

The log file contains the following personal data that could be used to identify a person:

- filenames and metadata of audio files on the USB drive
- volume name, brand and manufacturer of the USB drive

## Sharing usage & diagnostics data via Google

The Android Automotive system however may collect some information regarding the usage of the app and will also send
crash reports to the developer via internet. This is a feature implemented by Google, not by the app. [Check here to
learn more about this feature and how to turn it off](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6078260?hl=en) (however
as a developer I should point out that it is quite helpful to receive reports about crashes so I can improve the app).
