     * 1h = Recovered error — Indicates that the command completed successfully, with some recovery action performed by the device server.
     * 2h = Not Ready — Indicates that the logical unit is not accessible. Operator intervention may be required to correct this condition.
     * 3h = Medium Error — the command terminated with a non-recovered error condition that may have been caused by a flaw in the medium or an error in the recorded data.
     * 4h = Hardware Error — the device detected an unrecoverable hardware failure while performing the command or during a self-test.
     * 5h = Illegal Request — an illegal parameter in the command descriptor block or in the parameter list data.
     * 6h = Unit Attention — a power-on or reset has occurred to the device, or a not ready-to-ready transition has occurred, or an I/O element has been accessed. Also, this may indicate mode parameters have changed, or the microcode has been changed.
     * 7h = Data Protect — Indicates that a command that reads or writes the medium was attempted on a block that is protected. The read or write operation is not performed.
     * 8h = Blank Check — Indicates that a write-once device or a sequential-access device encountered blank medium or format-defined end-of-data indication while reading or that a write-once device encountered a non-blank medium while writing.
     * 9h = Vendor Specific
     * Ah = Copy Aborted — Indicates an EXTENDED COPY command was aborted due to an error condition on the source device, the destination device, or both.
     * Bh = Aborted Command — the device aborted the command. The initiator might be able to recover by trying the command again.
     * Ch = Reserved
     * Dh = Volume Overflow — Indicates that a buffered SCSI device has reached the end-of-partition and data may remain in the buffer that has not been written to the medium.
     * Eh = Miscompare — Indicates that the source data did not match the data read from the medium.
     * Fh = Completed — Indicates there is command completed sense data (see SAM-5) to be reported. This may occur for a successful command.
